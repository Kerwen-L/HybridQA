- train_extended.json, dev_extended.json: it's the same as train/dev.json, the only difference is there are more potential answer-nodes. A question can be ambiguous about whether the answer comes from table or passage.
- [NOTE]: these answer-nodes are generated by string-match-based heuristics, they are not guaranteed to be correct.
